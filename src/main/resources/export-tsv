Comparing Treatment Effects on Memory and Attention	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NEUROPSYCHOLOGIE											Primary objective and research design: In order to analyze whether neuropsychological memory therapy acts specifically on the memory domain or in a more generalized fashion on further cognitive domains, 27 patients with organic memory deficits due to different etiologies (cerebrovascular, traumatic, infectious, etc.) were randomly assigned to two different memory treatment programs and investigated for changes in memory and attention. Methods and procedures: Patients treated by a specific computer-based training of story recall (Training of Verbal Memory, TVM) were compared to a group in which compensational strategies for everyday memory problems were trained (Memory Therapy in Groups, MTG). Both therapies were conducted over 12 to 15 sessions, 4-5 times per week, in addition to standard program of neurorehabilitation. Training effects were assessed for verbal and figural memory (Verbal Learning Test, Nonverbal Learning Test) and for attention (Alertness and Divided Attention in Test Battery of Attentional Performance). Results and conclusions: Both treatment groups resulted in improvement in tests of memory but not attention. This finding provides good evidence for the assumption of specificity of effects in neuropsychological treatment of memory.												1016-264X		10.1024/1016-264X/a000019			DEC	2010	21	4				239	245						ISI:000285072600002

A Digital Spot-mapping Method for Avian Field Studies	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY											Avian mapping, also known as spot mapping or territory mapping, is a breeding season bird-survey technique that traditionally uses paper maps on which locations of birds are recorded. This method is often considered the most accurate in yielding a density, but has been criticized as being inefficient, time consuming, and inexact. We describe a novel digital-mapping method, incorporating a hand-held computer and high-accuracy global positioning system receiver (GPS), used in an ongoing boreal birds study. Digital mapping surpassed our expectations as to efficiency, flexibility, and work flow. We expect this method will become increasingly useful in many types of field studies, especially as costs decrease (currently similar to$2,100 for the field receiver used). Received 4 January 2010.

Expanded HIV Screening in the United States: What Will It Cost Government Discretionary and Entitlement Programs? A Budget Impact Analysis	VALUE IN HEALTH											Objective: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently revised their HIV screening guidelines to promote testing and earlier entry to care. Prior analyses have examined the policy's cost-effectiveness but have not evaluated its impact on government budgets. Methods: We used a simulation model of HIV screening, disease, and treatment to determine the budget impact of expanded HIV screening to US government discretionary, entitlement, and testing programs. We estimated total and incremental testing and treatment costs over a 5-year time horizon under current and expanded screening scenarios. We used CDC estimates of HIV prevalence and annual incidence, and considered variations in screening frequency, test return rates, linkage to care, test characteristics, and eligibility for government screening and treatment programs. Results: Under current practice, 177,000 new HIV cases will be identified over 5 years. Expanded screening will identify an additional 46,000 cases at an incremental 5-year cost of $2.7 billion. The financial burden of expanded HIV screening will fall disproportionately on discretionary programs that fund care for newly identified patients and will not be offset by entitlement program savings. Testing will represent a small proportion (18%) of the total budget increase. Costs are sensitive to the frequency of screening and the proportion linked to care. Conclusions: The expanded HIV screening program will have a large downstream impact on government programs that fund HIV care. Expanded HIV screening will not meet early treatment goals unless government programs have sufficient budgets to expand testing and provide care for newly identified cases.												1098-3015		10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00763.x			DEC	2010	13	8				893	902						ISI:000285066200007

It has been a serious concern since the early 20th century. Until now, only limited research has been performed to predict reflection cracking. Mechanistic-based models were calibrated to field data to produce a design process for predicting reflection cracks. Three cracking mechanisms (bending, shearing traffic stresses, and thermal stress) were taken into account to evaluate the rate of growth of the three increasing levels of distress severity (low, medium, and high). The cumulative damage done by all three cracking mechanisms is used to predict the number of days for the reflection crack to reach the surface of the overlay. The result of this calculation is calibrated to the observed field data (severity and extent), which has been fitted with an S-shaped curve. In the mechanistic computations, material properties and fracture-related stress intensity factors are generated using efficient artificial neural network algorithms. The axle load spectra were used to represent traffic stresses, and a new model of predicting pavement temperature was incorporated into the thermal stress model. The HMA overlay was over either asphalt pavement or jointed concrete pavement in all four major climatic zones. The results of this calculated mechanistic approach showed HMA's ability to efficiently reproduce field observations of the growth extent and severity of reflection cracking. The computer run ning time for a 20-year prediction of a typical overlay was between I and 4 min.												0361-1981		10.3141/2155-05				2010		2155				43	54						ISI:000285075000005

Consequently, it is important to be able to accurately predict the complete folding pathway of an RNA molecule. The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme is a small catalytic RNA with the greatest number of folding intermediates making it the model of choice with which to address this problem. The tertiary structures of the known putative intermediates along the folding pathway of the HDV ribozyme were predicted using the Macromolecular Conformations Symbolic programming (MC-Sym) software. The structures obtained by this method received physical support from Selective 2'-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE). The analysis of these structures elucidated several features of the HDV ribozyme. In addition, this report represents an application for MC-Sym that permits progression one step further toward the computer prediction of an RNA molecule-folding pathway.												0969-2126		10.1016/j.str.2010.09.024			DEC 8	2010	18	12				1608	1616						ISI:000285221100009

The VS can be a practical framework for non-real-time, asynchronous message transfer (especially for large messages) in a cost-effective manner. In this study, a critical implementation design issue, the message forward scheduling, in the VS approach is discussed and investigated through computer simulation by our developed VS simulator that has reflected the results of the field experiment for realistic performance evaluation.
